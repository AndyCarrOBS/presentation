## Research Challenges Encountered

1. **Data Availability:**
   - Many operators don't publicly disclose subscriber numbers
   - Some data is aggregated at parent company level (e.g., Liberty Global, Vodafone Group)
   - Public broadcasters may not have traditional "subscribers"

2. **Data Variations:**
   - Different sources report different numbers
   - Data from different years (2020-2025)
   - Different metrics (subscribers vs TV homes vs customers)

3. **Mergers & Acquisitions:**
   - Many operators have merged (Unitymedia → Vodafone, Ziggo → UPC)
   - Some operators sold to other companies (DigiTV → 4iG)

4. **Operator Identification:**
   - Some entries are standards/specifications (DVB-T2, CableHDReady)
   - Generic names (Digital TV, etc.)
   - M7 Group operators need clarification

## Operators Still Needing Research

### High Priority
- Telenet (Belgium)
- YouSee (Denmark)
- Norlys (Denmark)
- Allente (multiple countries)
- M7 Group operators (Skylink CZ/SK, Canal Digitaal, etc.)
- UPC operators (Switzerland, Poland, Romania, Hungary)
- Virgin Media (Ireland)
- Tivusat (Italy)
- Fransat (France)

### Medium Priority
- Smaller country-specific operators
- Regional operators
- Public broadcasters (may not have subscribers)

### Low Priority
- Standards/specifications (need to identify and exclude)
- Generic names (need clarification)

## Market Insights Found

### Overall Market Size
- **Europe Total:** ~180 million pay-TV subscribers (2024)
- **Western Europe:** Projected to decline from 107M to 100M (2021-2027)
- **Eastern Europe:** ~30 million pay-TV households in CEE region

### Major Players

- **Vodafone:** ~17.0 million subscribers
- **Tricolor:** ~14.9 million subscribers

### Trends

- Smart TV adoption surpassing pay-TV
- Shift to OTT/streaming services

## Next Steps

1. Continue searching for specific operator data
2. Focus on operators with no data
3. Verify conflicting data points
4. Update JSON and HTML files as data is found
5. Note data sources and dates for all entries
6. Consider reaching out to operators directly for data

- ✅ `operators-subscribers.json` - Updated with new data
- ✅ `operators-subscribers-research.md` - Research tracking

## Notes

- Subscriber numbers are approximate and subject to change
- Data sources vary in reliability and recency
- Some operators may have merged or been acquired
- Public broadcasters may not have traditional "subscribers"
- Standards/specifications should be identified and excluded from subscriber counts
