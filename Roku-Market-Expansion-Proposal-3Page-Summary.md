## Proposed Approach

### Phase 1: Market Analysis & Partner Identification (Weeks 1-4)

**Market mapping identifies key broadcasters, OTT platforms, regulatory requirements (must-carry, LCN, prominence), and technical specifications (HbbTV, app requirements, CI+ compatibility) per market, while analyzing the competitive landscape.** **Market prioritization focuses on high connectivity and smart TV adoption rates, with consumer OTT demand as a leading success indicator.** Partner prioritization ranks partners by market impact and strategic value, identifies decision-makers and key contacts, and assesses partnership readiness and requirements. **CI+ rollout status and adoption rates are evaluated per market to identify opportunities for conditional access and premium content distribution.**

**Deliverables**: Market analysis reports per country (including connectivity, smart TV adoption, OTT demand metrics), partner engagement roadmap, regulatory compliance checklist, technical requirements matrix, CI+ market assessment, market prioritization ranking.

### Phase 2: Broadcaster & Operator Engagement (Weeks 5-12)

**Initial outreach engages broadcasters as Roku representatives, positioning Roku as a non-threatening partner that adds value through prominence, cost reduction, and audience reach, while scheduling technical and business discussions.** Partnership development understands broadcaster objectives and pain points, aligns Roku capabilities with broadcaster needs, develops partnership proposals, and negotiates terms and agreements. **Content and channel strategy discussions prioritize driving Roku TVOS, channel, and content availability to ensure compelling local content that meets consumer demand and drives platform adoption.** **CI+ integration discussions explore conditional access opportunities, premium content distribution models, and CI+ certification requirements with broadcasters and operators.** **Key messages**: Roku adds value (prominence, cost reduction, audience growth), complements broadcaster objectives, commits to local content and regulatory compliance, supports HbbTV, proprietary apps, and CI+ standards.

**Deliverables**: Partner engagement tracker, partnership proposals, signed letters of intent/agreements, technical requirements documentation, CI+ integration plans, content and channel strategy roadmap.

**Testing & validation accesses test material from content partners, executes testing protocols, validates compliance with local requirements, tests CI+ module functionality and conditional access workflows, and provides feedback to Roku teams and content partners.** **Iterative automated testing framework enables Roku technical teams to maintain product fleet compliance and alignment with local partner needs, driving positive testing experiences with local partners and volunteering compliant test results for each software update.** **Deliverables**: Technical specifications documentation, ported applications (per broadcaster/OTT), LCN listings implementation, must-carry compliance verification, CI+ integration and certification, Roku TVOS channel and content implementation, automated testing framework and test results, feedback reports.

### Phase 4: Launch Support & Optimization (Weeks 25-36)

**Launch coordination coordinates market launches with partners, supports go-to-market activities, monitors launch performance, addresses post-launch issues, and validates CI+ functionality in live environments.** **Performance monitoring tracks consumer OTT demand indicators, smart TV adoption rates, and connectivity metrics to validate market prioritization and identify expansion opportunities.** **Ongoing automated testing continues to keep Roku product fleet compliant and aligned with local partner needs, with each software update generating compliant test results that are proactively shared with local partners to drive positive testing experiences and maintain trust.**

**Relationship management maintains ongoing partner relationships, gathers feedback and iterates, identifies expansion opportunities, supports additional market entry, and monitors CI+ adoption and premium content performance.** **Deliverables**: Launch readiness reports, performance monitoring dashboards (including OTT demand, connectivity, smart TV adoption metrics), partner feedback summaries, CI+ performance metrics, Roku TVOS channel and content performance analysis, automated testing results per software update, expansion recommendations.
