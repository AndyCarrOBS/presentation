## 4. Growth Assessment

### 4.1 Market Position

- Ranking vs. competitors: Largest quadruple play provider in Denmark
- Strength in broadband, mobile, and TV: Strong in cable TV and broadband, mobile presence, quad-play bundles
- Differentiators: Quad-play bundles, extensive cable network, TDC Group infrastructure support

### 4.2 Growth Indicators

- Subscriber trends across FTTH, broadband, TV, and mobile: Customer base declining overall, but high-speed broadband showing growth
- ARPU trends: Price increases in September 2024 (20-50 DKK/month) due to sports content costs
- Network upgrades: High-speed broadband expansion, fiber investments
- New service launches: Enhanced broadband services, streaming integration

### 4.3 Decline Indicators

- Cord-cutting pressure: Significant pressure from OTT competitors
- Regulatory or pricing pressure: Price increases reflect cost pressures, particularly sports rights
- Content rights losses: Standard content portfolio maintained, but sports rights costs increasing
- Competitive erosion from OTT: Competition from Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, local streaming services

### **Overall Assessment**

- **Operator Status:** Decline

- **Drivers Behind the Trend:** Customer base has declined significantly from 1.4 million (2015) to ~845,000 (2025), representing ~40% decline over 10 years. This reflects broader market trends including cord-cutting, OTT competition, and changing consumer preferences. Price increases in 2024 (20-50 DKK/month) due to sports content rights costs may further pressure customer retention. However, high-speed broadband services showing growth provides some offset. TDC NET infrastructure arm showing slight revenue decline (-0.1%) reflects market challenges.
