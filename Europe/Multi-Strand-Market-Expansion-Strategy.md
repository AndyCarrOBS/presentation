## Cross-Strand Strategic Considerations

### 1. Resource Allocation
**Sequential vs Parallel Execution:**
- **Strand 1**: Sequential (Netherlands → Denmark → Nordic expansion → Ireland)
- **Strand 2**: Parallel possible (Belgium + France can run simultaneously)
- **Strand 3**: Sequential (DACH → Italy)
- **Strand 4**: Sequential (Czech/Poland → Eastern expansion)

**Recommended Approach:**
- Execute Strand 1 and Strand 2 in parallel (different regions, different languages)
- Execute Strand 3 after Strand 1/2 completion (leverage learnings)
- Execute Strand 4 after Strand 3 completion (leverage M7 platform learnings)

### 2. Technical Infrastructure Reuse
**Common Platforms Across Strands:**
- **M7 Group**: Present in Netherlands (Canal Digitaal), Belgium (Telesat), Luxembourg (Telesat), Austria (HD Austria), Czech Republic (Skylink CZ), Slovakia (Skylink SK), Hungary (UPC Direct)
- **Allente**: Nordic-wide platform (Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway)
- **UPC/Vodafone**: Present in multiple markets (Netherlands, Belgium, Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Romania)

**Infrastructure Leverage:**
- M7 platform integration in one market enables rapid expansion to other M7 markets
- Allente integration in Denmark unlocks entire Nordic region
- UPC/Vodafone integration learnings apply across multiple markets
