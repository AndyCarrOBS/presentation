  - Service tier (FTA vs encrypted)
  - Operator's technical implementation
  - Regional variations
- Many operators provide their own STBs which handle decryption internally
- CI+ cam is primarily needed when using third-party TVs or receivers with encrypted cable/satellite services
- Some platforms use smart cards directly in receivers rather than CI+ cam modules
- M7 Group platforms typically use smart cards; CI+ cam compatibility depends on the receiver model

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Categorize operators (Telco/TV Platform/FTA)
2. ✅ Research CI+ cam requirements (general patterns identified)
3. Add CI+ cam requirement information to overlay in index.html
