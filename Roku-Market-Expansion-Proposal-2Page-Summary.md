---

## Executive Summary

**Objective**: Enable Roku to expand beyond UK and Germany (where content partners are already on board) into new European markets by engaging local broadcasters and OTT platforms, ensuring compliance with local requirements, and positioning Roku as a non-threatening partner that adds value to broadcaster objectives.

**Approach**: Embed 1-2 experienced team members within Roku to act as Roku representatives, leveraging deep market knowledge and the successful Germany model to engage broadcasters, operators, and content partners across target markets.

**Outcome**: Successful market entry with local content partnerships, compliant LCN listings, must-carry compliance, ported OTT applications, and automated testing framework for ongoing product fleet compliance, building on the established Germany foundation.

## Market Opportunity

### Current Position & Expansion Targets
- **Established Markets**: UK, Germany (content partners on board: ARD, ZDF, RTL, ProSiebenSat.1, etc.)
- **Expansion Targets**: Austria, Switzerland, Netherlands, France, Belgium, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Luxembourg, **Italy, Spain**
- **Market Size**: 50+ million free-to-air households across expansion target markets
- **Foundation**: Proven Germany model (must-carry compliance, HbbTV support, automated testing) enables rapid expansion

### Market Characteristics (Beyond Germany)
- **Strong local content preference**: Public service broadcasters (ORF, SRG SSR, NPO, France Télévisions, RAI, RTVE) and commercial broadcasters (TF1, M6, Mediaset, Atresmedia) dominate viewing
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Must-carry rules, LCN listings, prominence requirements vary by country (similar patterns to Germany)
- **Technical Requirements**: HbbTV support, proprietary app porting, platform certification, CI+ compatibility

**Key Requirements**: Broadcasters need guaranteed prominence, must-carry/LCN compliance, cost-effective distribution, and support for both HbbTV and proprietary applications. **Market research indicates that pay-TV and pay-lite services may provide better market share opportunities based on active broadcaster investments and revenue potential.** Additionally, **CI+ rollout may help drive market access** by enabling conditional access and premium content distribution through standardized interfaces.

**Market Prioritization Strategy**: **Prioritize markets with high connectivity and smart TV adoption rates**, as these indicators directly correlate with Roku platform success. **Consumer demand for OTT services is a leading indicator for Roku success**, making markets with strong streaming adoption and high broadband penetration ideal targets. **Driving Roku TVOS, channel, and content availability is key to making market engagement successful**, ensuring the platform offers compelling local content that meets consumer expectations and drives adoption. **Leverage Germany success**: Use proven Germany model (ARD/ZDF integration, RTL/ProSiebenSat.1 partnerships, HbbTV support, automated testing) as blueprint for expansion.

## Proposed Approach

### Phase 1: Market Analysis & Partner Identification (Weeks 1-4)
**Market mapping identifies key broadcasters, OTT platforms, regulatory requirements (must-carry, LCN, prominence), and technical specifications (HbbTV, app requirements, CI+ compatibility) per market, while analyzing the competitive landscape.** **Market prioritization focuses on high connectivity and smart TV adoption rates, with consumer OTT demand as a leading success indicator.** Partner prioritization ranks partners by market impact and strategic value, identifies decision-makers and key contacts, and assesses partnership readiness and requirements. **CI+ rollout status and adoption rates are evaluated per market to identify opportunities for conditional access and premium content distribution.**

**Deliverables**: Market analysis reports per country (including connectivity, smart TV adoption, OTT demand metrics), partner engagement roadmap, regulatory compliance checklist, technical requirements matrix, CI+ market assessment, market prioritization ranking.

### Phase 2: Broadcaster & Operator Engagement (Weeks 5-12)
**Initial outreach engages broadcasters as Roku representatives, positioning Roku as a non-threatening partner that adds value through prominence, cost reduction, and audience reach, while scheduling technical and business discussions.** Partnership development understands broadcaster objectives and pain points, aligns Roku capabilities with broadcaster needs, develops partnership proposals, and negotiates terms and agreements. **Content and channel strategy discussions prioritize driving Roku TVOS, channel, and content availability to ensure compelling local content that meets consumer demand and drives platform adoption.** **CI+ integration discussions explore conditional access opportunities, premium content distribution models, and CI+ certification requirements with broadcasters and operators.** **Key messages**: Roku adds value (prominence, cost reduction, audience growth), complements broadcaster objectives, commits to local content and regulatory compliance, supports HbbTV, proprietary apps, and CI+ standards.

**Deliverables**: Partner engagement tracker, partnership proposals, signed letters of intent/agreements, technical requirements documentation, CI+ integration plans, content and channel strategy roadmap.

### Phase 3: Technical Integration (Weeks 13-24)
**Specification access obtains technical specifications from broadcasters, accesses HbbTV requirements and standards, documents LCN listing requirements, gathers must-carry compliance requirements, and evaluates CI+ module integration and certification needs.** Application porting ports OTT applications to Roku platform, ensures HbbTV compatibility where required, implements LCN listings and channel numbering, configures must-carry compliance, and integrates CI+ support for conditional access and premium content. **Roku TVOS, channel, and content development prioritizes markets with high connectivity and smart TV adoption, ensuring content availability aligns with consumer OTT demand.**

**Testing & validation accesses test material from content partners, executes testing protocols, validates compliance with local requirements, tests CI+ module functionality and conditional access workflows, and provides feedback to Roku teams and content partners.** **Iterative automated testing framework enables Roku technical teams to maintain product fleet compliance and alignment with local partner needs, driving positive testing experiences with local partners and volunteering compliant test results for each software update.** **Deliverables**: Technical specifications documentation, ported applications (per broadcaster/OTT), LCN listings implementation, must-carry compliance verification, CI+ integration and certification, Roku TVOS channel and content implementation, automated testing framework and test results, feedback reports.

### Phase 4: Launch Support & Optimization (Weeks 25-36)
**Launch coordination coordinates market launches with partners, supports go-to-market activities, monitors launch performance, addresses post-launch issues, and validates CI+ functionality in live environments.** **Performance monitoring tracks consumer OTT demand indicators, smart TV adoption rates, and connectivity metrics to validate market prioritization and identify expansion opportunities.** **Ongoing automated testing continues to keep Roku product fleet compliant and aligned with local partner needs, with each software update generating compliant test results that are proactively shared with local partners to drive positive testing experiences and maintain trust.**

**Relationship management maintains ongoing partner relationships, gathers feedback and iterates, identifies expansion opportunities, supports additional market entry, and monitors CI+ adoption and premium content performance.** **Deliverables**: Launch readiness reports, performance monitoring dashboards (including OTT demand, connectivity, smart TV adoption metrics), partner feedback summaries, CI+ performance metrics, Roku TVOS channel and content performance analysis, automated testing results per software update, expansion recommendations.
