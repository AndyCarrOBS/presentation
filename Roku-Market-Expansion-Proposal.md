# Roku Market Expansion Proposal
## Engaging Local Content Partners Across Europe

---

## Executive Summary

**Objective**: Enable Roku to expand beyond UK and Germany (where content partners are already on board) into new European markets through a **budget-conscious, sequential approach targeting one country at a time**. Engage local broadcasters and OTT platforms, ensure compliance with local requirements, and position Roku as a non-threatening partner that adds value to broadcaster objectives.

**Approach**: Embed 1-2 experienced team members within Roku to act as Roku representatives, leveraging deep market knowledge and the successful Germany model to engage broadcasters, operators, and content partners **in carefully selected markets, one country at a time**.

**Outcome**: Successful sequential market entry with local content partnerships, compliant LCN listings, must-carry compliance, and ported OTT applications, building on the established Germany foundation and previous market successes.

## Market Opportunity

### Current Position
- **UK**: Established market presence
- **Germany**: Established market presence with content partners on board (ARD, ZDF, RTL, ProSiebenSat.1, etc.)
- **Expansion Targets**: Austria, Switzerland, Netherlands, France, Belgium, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Luxembourg, **Italy, Spain**

**Foundation**: With German content partners already integrated, Roku has a proven model for engaging public service broadcasters (must-carry compliance), commercial broadcasters (revenue sharing, prominence), and technical integration (HbbTV, proprietary apps, LCN listings, CI+). This foundation enables rapid expansion to adjacent markets.

### Market Characteristics (Beyond Germany)
- **50+ million free-to-air households** across expansion target markets
- **Strong local content preference**: Public service broadcasters (ORF, SRG SSR, NPO, France Télévisions, RAI, RTVE) and commercial broadcasters (TF1, M6, Mediaset, Atresmedia) dominate viewing
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Must-carry rules, LCN listings, prominence requirements vary by country (similar patterns to Germany)
- **Technical Requirements**: HbbTV support, proprietary app porting, platform certification, CI+ compatibility

**Key Requirements**: Broadcasters need guaranteed prominence, must-carry/LCN compliance, cost-effective distribution, and support for both HbbTV and proprietary applications. **Market research indicates that pay-TV and pay-lite services may provide better market share opportunities based on active broadcaster investments and revenue potential.** Additionally, **CI+ rollout may help drive market access** by enabling conditional access and premium content distribution through standardized interfaces.

**Market Prioritization Strategy**: **Sequential, one-country-at-a-time approach** to maximize budget efficiency and ensure successful market entry before expanding further. **Prioritize markets with high connectivity and smart TV adoption rates**, as these indicators directly correlate with Roku platform success. **Consumer demand for OTT services is a leading indicator for Roku success**, making markets with strong streaming adoption and high broadband penetration ideal targets. **Driving Roku TVOS, channel, and content availability is key to making market engagement successful**, ensuring the platform offers compelling local content that meets consumer expectations and drives adoption. **Leverage Germany success**: Use proven Germany model (ARD/ZDF integration, RTL/ProSiebenSat.1 partnerships, HbbTV support, automated testing) as blueprint for each sequential market entry.
