## Proposed Approach

### Phase 1: Market Analysis & Partner Identification (Weeks 1-4)

**Market mapping identifies key broadcasters, OTT platforms, regulatory requirements (must-carry, LCN, prominence), and technical specifications (HbbTV, app requirements) per market, while analyzing the competitive landscape.** Partner prioritization ranks partners by market impact and strategic value, identifies decision-makers and key contacts, and assesses partnership readiness and requirements.

**Deliverables**: Market analysis reports per country, partner engagement roadmap, regulatory compliance checklist, technical requirements matrix.

---

### Phase 2: Broadcaster & Operator Engagement (Weeks 5-12)

**Initial outreach engages broadcasters as Roku representatives, positioning Roku as a non-threatening partner that adds value through prominence, cost reduction, and audience reach, while scheduling technical and business discussions.** Partnership development understands broadcaster objectives and pain points, aligns Roku capabilities with broadcaster needs, develops partnership proposals, and negotiates terms and agreements. **Key messages**: Roku adds value (prominence, cost reduction, audience growth), complements broadcaster objectives, commits to local content and regulatory compliance, supports HbbTV and proprietary apps.

**Deliverables**: Partner engagement tracker, partnership proposals, signed letters of intent/agreements, technical requirements documentation.

---

### Phase 3: Technical Integration (Weeks 13-24)

**Specification access obtains technical specifications from broadcasters, accesses HbbTV requirements and standards, documents LCN listing requirements, and gathers must-carry compliance requirements.** Application porting ports OTT applications to Roku platform, ensures HbbTV compatibility where required, implements LCN listings and channel numbering, and configures must-carry compliance.

**Testing & validation accesses test material from content partners, executes testing protocols, validates compliance with local requirements, and provides feedback to Roku teams and content partners.** **Deliverables**: Technical specifications documentation, ported applications (per broadcaster/OTT), LCN listings implementation, must-carry compliance verification, test results and feedback reports.

---

### Phase 4: Launch Support & Optimization (Weeks 25-36)

**Launch coordination coordinates market launches with partners, supports go-to-market activities, monitors launch performance, and addresses post-launch issues.** Relationship management maintains ongoing partner relationships, gathers feedback and iterates, identifies expansion opportunities, and supports additional market entry.

**Deliverables**: Launch readiness reports, performance monitoring dashboards, partner feedback summaries, expansion recommendations.
