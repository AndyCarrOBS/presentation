## Executive Summary

**Objective**: Enable Roku to expand beyond UK and Germany (where content partners are already on board) into new European markets through a **budget-conscious, sequential approach targeting one country at a time**. Engage local broadcasters and OTT platforms, ensure compliance with local requirements, and position Roku as a non-threatening partner that adds value to broadcaster objectives.

**Approach**: Embed 1-2 experienced team members within Roku to act as Roku representatives, leveraging deep market knowledge and the successful Germany model to engage broadcasters, operators, and content partners **in carefully selected markets, one country at a time**.

**Outcome**: Successful sequential market entry with local content partnerships, compliant LCN listings, must-carry compliance, and ported OTT applications, building on the established Germany foundation and previous market successes.

## Market Opportunity

### Current Position
- **UK**: Established market presence
- **Germany**: Established market presence with content partners on board (ARD, ZDF, RTL, ProSiebenSat.1, etc.)
- **Expansion Targets**: Austria, Switzerland, Netherlands, France, Belgium, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Luxembourg, **Italy, Spain**

**Foundation**: With German content partners already integrated, Roku has a proven model for engaging public service broadcasters (must-carry compliance), commercial broadcasters (revenue sharing, prominence), and technical integration (HbbTV, proprietary apps, LCN listings, CI+). This foundation enables rapid expansion to adjacent markets.

### Market Characteristics (Beyond Germany)
- **50+ million free-to-air households** across expansion target markets
- **Strong local content preference**: Public service broadcasters (ORF, SRG SSR, NPO, France Télévisions, RAI, RTVE) and commercial broadcasters (TF1, M6, Mediaset, Atresmedia) dominate viewing
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Must-carry rules, LCN listings, prominence requirements vary by country (similar patterns to Germany)
- **Technical Requirements**: HbbTV support, proprietary app porting, platform certification, CI+ compatibility

**Key Requirements**: Broadcasters need guaranteed prominence, must-carry/LCN compliance, cost-effective distribution, and support for both HbbTV and proprietary applications. **Market research indicates that pay-TV and pay-lite services may provide better market share opportunities based on active broadcaster investments and revenue potential.** Additionally, **CI+ rollout may help drive market access** by enabling conditional access and premium content distribution through standardized interfaces.

**Market Prioritization Strategy**: **Sequential, one-country-at-a-time approach** to maximize budget efficiency and ensure successful market entry before expanding further. **Prioritize markets with high connectivity and smart TV adoption rates**, as these indicators directly correlate with Roku platform success. **Consumer demand for OTT services is a leading indicator for Roku success**, making markets with strong streaming adoption and high broadband penetration ideal targets. **Driving Roku TVOS, channel, and content availability is key to making market engagement successful**, ensuring the platform offers compelling local content that meets consumer expectations and drives adoption. **Leverage Germany success**: Use proven Germany model (ARD/ZDF integration, RTL/ProSiebenSat.1 partnerships, HbbTV support, automated testing) as blueprint for each sequential market entry.

## Proposed Approach

### Phase 1: Market Analysis & Partner Identification (Weeks 1-4) - Single Country Focus

**Market mapping identifies key broadcasters, OTT platforms, regulatory requirements (must-carry, LCN, prominence), and technical specifications (HbbTV, app requirements, CI+ compatibility) for the selected target market, while analyzing the competitive landscape.** **Market prioritization focuses on high connectivity and smart TV adoption rates, with consumer OTT demand as a leading success indicator for country selection.** Partner prioritization ranks partners by market impact and strategic value, identifies decision-makers and key contacts, and assesses partnership readiness and requirements. **CI+ rollout status and adoption rates are evaluated to identify opportunities for conditional access and premium content distribution.**

**Deliverables**: Market analysis report for selected country (including connectivity, smart TV adoption, OTT demand metrics), partner engagement roadmap, regulatory compliance checklist, technical requirements matrix, CI+ market assessment.

---

### Phase 2: Broadcaster & Operator Engagement (Weeks 5-12)

**Initial outreach engages broadcasters as Roku representatives, positioning Roku as a non-threatening partner that adds value through prominence, cost reduction, and audience reach, while scheduling technical and business discussions.** Partnership development understands broadcaster objectives and pain points, aligns Roku capabilities with broadcaster needs, develops partnership proposals, and negotiates terms and agreements. **Content and channel strategy discussions prioritize driving Roku TVOS, channel, and content availability to ensure compelling local content that meets consumer demand and drives platform adoption.** **CI+ integration discussions explore conditional access opportunities, premium content distribution models, and CI+ certification requirements with broadcasters and operators.** **Key messages**: Roku adds value (prominence, cost reduction, audience growth), complements broadcaster objectives, commits to local content and regulatory compliance, supports HbbTV, proprietary apps, and CI+ standards.

**Deliverables**: Partner engagement tracker, partnership proposals, signed letters of intent/agreements, technical requirements documentation, CI+ integration plans, content and channel strategy roadmap.

### Phase 3: Technical Integration (Weeks 13-24)

**Specification access obtains technical specifications from broadcasters, accesses HbbTV requirements and standards, documents LCN listing requirements, gathers must-carry compliance requirements, and evaluates CI+ module integration and certification needs.** Application porting ports OTT applications to Roku platform, ensures HbbTV compatibility where required, implements LCN listings and channel numbering, configures must-carry compliance, and integrates CI+ support for conditional access and premium content. **Roku TVOS, channel, and content development prioritizes markets with high connectivity and smart TV adoption, ensuring content availability aligns with consumer OTT demand.**

**Testing & validation accesses test material from content partners, executes testing protocols, validates compliance with local requirements, tests CI+ module functionality and conditional access workflows, and provides feedback to Roku teams and content partners.** **Iterative automated testing framework enables Roku technical teams to maintain product fleet compliance and alignment with local partner needs, driving positive testing experiences with local partners and volunteering compliant test results for each software update.** **Deliverables**: Technical specifications documentation, ported applications (per broadcaster/OTT), LCN listings implementation, must-carry compliance verification, CI+ integration and certification, Roku TVOS channel and content implementation, automated testing framework and test results, feedback reports.

---

### Phase 4: Launch Support & Optimization (Weeks 25-36) - Single Country Focus

**Launch coordination coordinates market launch in the target country with partners, supports go-to-market activities, monitors launch performance, addresses post-launch issues, and validates CI+ functionality in live environments.** **Performance monitoring tracks consumer OTT demand indicators, smart TV adoption rates, and connectivity metrics to validate market success and inform next country selection.** **Ongoing automated testing continues to keep Roku product fleet compliant and aligned with local partner needs, with each software update generating compliant test results that are proactively shared with local partners to drive positive testing experiences and maintain trust.**

**Relationship management maintains ongoing partner relationships, gathers feedback and iterates, evaluates market success, and prepares for next country expansion based on learnings and budget availability.** **Deliverables**: Launch readiness reports, performance monitoring dashboards (including OTT demand, connectivity, smart TV adoption metrics), partner feedback summaries, CI+ performance metrics, Roku TVOS channel and content performance analysis, automated testing results per software update, market success evaluation and next country recommendations.
