# Research Progress Update

**Date:** 2024-12-05  
**Status:** Ongoing research

## New Data Found

### Germany
- **Deutsche Telekom Magenta TV:** ~4.7 million subscribers (June 2025)
- **Total Market:** 15.2 million pay-TV subscriptions (2024)

### Poland
- **Cyfrowy Polsat:** ~5.12 million subscribers (2020)
- **Total Market:** 11.1 million subscribers, 76.3% household penetration (2024)

### France
- **Orange France:** ~7.6-11.6 million IPTV subscribers (varies by source/year)
- **Free France (Iliad):** ~6.7-8.6 million IPTV subscribers (varies by source/year)
- **Canal+ France:** ~4.7-9.1 million subscribers (varies by reporting method)

### Netherlands
- **Ziggo:** 3.83 million TV households (2020) - already in system

## Research Challenges

1. **Data Variations:** Different sources report different numbers for the same operator
2. **Year Differences:** Data ranges from 2020-2025, making comparisons difficult
3. **Metric Differences:** Some report "subscribers", others "TV households", "customers", or "homes"
4. **Reporting Methods:** Some operators report total customers vs. TV-only customers
5. **Mergers & Acquisitions:** Many operators have merged (e.g., Unitymedia → Vodafone)

## Next Steps

1. Continue searching for specific operators
2. Focus on operators with no data yet
3. Verify conflicting data points
4. Update JSON and HTML files as data is found
5. Note data sources and dates for all entries

## Operators Still Needing Research

- Most M7 Group operators (Skylink, Canal Digitaal, etc.)
- Many smaller country-specific operators
- Public broadcasters (may not have traditional subscribers)
- Standards/specifications (need to identify and exclude)
