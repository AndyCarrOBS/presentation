- **Regulatory Requirements**: Must-carry rules, LCN listings, prominence requirements vary by country (similar patterns to Germany)
- **Technical Requirements**: HbbTV support, proprietary app porting, platform certification, CI+ compatibility

**Key Requirements**: Broadcasters need guaranteed prominence, must-carry/LCN compliance, cost-effective distribution, and support for both HbbTV and proprietary applications. **Market research indicates that pay-TV and pay-lite services may provide better market share opportunities based on active broadcaster investments and revenue potential.** Additionally, **CI+ rollout may help drive market access** by enabling conditional access and premium content distribution through standardized interfaces.

**Market Prioritization Strategy**: **Sequential, one-country-at-a-time approach** to maximize budget efficiency and ensure successful market entry before expanding further. **Prioritize markets with high connectivity and smart TV adoption rates**, as these indicators directly correlate with Roku platform success. **Consumer demand for OTT services is a leading indicator for Roku success**, making markets with strong streaming adoption and high broadband penetration ideal targets. **Italy and Spain are high-priority targets** due to large free-to-air markets (25-27M combined households), strong OTT adoption (Italy: 12.5% streaming growth, Spain: 61.9% streaming platform usage), and high smart TV penetration (Italy: 22.4M smart TVs, Spain: 75% penetration). **Driving Roku TVOS, channel, and content availability is key to making market engagement successful**, ensuring the platform offers compelling local content that meets consumer expectations and drives adoption. **Leverage Germany success**: Use proven Germany model (ARD/ZDF integration, RTL/ProSiebenSat.1 partnerships, HbbTV support, automated testing) as blueprint for each sequential market entry.
