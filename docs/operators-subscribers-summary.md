## Challenges Encountered

1. **Data Availability:** Many operators don't publicly disclose subscriber numbers
2. **Data Consistency:** Different sources report different numbers for the same operator
3. **Date Variations:** Data from different years makes comparison difficult
4. **Mergers & Acquisitions:** Many operators have merged (e.g., Unitymedia → Vodafone, Ziggo → UPC)
5. **Definition Variations:** "Subscribers" vs "TV Homes" vs "Customers" - definitions vary
6. **Standards vs Operators:** Some entries are technical standards (DVB-T2, CableHDReady) not operators

---

## Next Steps

1. Continue researching individual operators through:
   - Company annual reports
   - Investor relations pages
   - Regulatory filings
   - Industry research reports

2. Verify conflicting data points
3. Update JSON file as new data is found
4. Note data sources and dates for all entries
5. Distinguish between "subscribers" and "TV homes" where applicable

## Notes

- Subscriber numbers are approximate and subject to change
- Many figures are from 2020-2023; market may have changed
- Some operators may have merged or been acquired since data collection
- Public broadcasters (ORF, etc.) may not have traditional "subscribers"
- Some entries may be standards/specifications rather than operators
